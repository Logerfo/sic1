Congratulations, {{self.name}}! SIC Systems has accepted your job application.

I'm {{from.name}}, and I'm excited to have you join our team! We're working very hard to ship our flagship product, the SIC-1, on time and we need all the help we can get.

Your job will be to implement programs as they're assigned to you. Your solutions will be compared to other employees' solutions on the basis of execution time (measured in cycles) and memory usage (measured in bytes).

You should have already received a couple of electronic mails from our automated onboarding system that you can review:

* The SIC-1 Reference Manual, which includes details on `subleq` and SIC-1 Assembly Language
* A guide to the SIC-1 Development Environment (including usage information, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)

You can view these mails at any time in the electronic mail viewer.

Thanks in advance for your dedication! There's a lot of room to grow at this company, so your efforts will be well rewarded.
