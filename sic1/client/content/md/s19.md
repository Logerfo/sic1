{{self.name}}, do you have a few minutes to drop by my office?

I'd like to know if you have put any thought into joining Jerin and I to work on that exciting new natural language processing project I mentioned to you a little while back. It could mean a big promotion for you!

If you have any concerns, please, please let me know. It would be a shame to see your talents wasted on another team, to be honest. We're really working on some revolutionary stuff here!

I'll stop by your cubicle in an hour or so, in case I don't hear from you by then.

Thanks!
