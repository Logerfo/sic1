Hopefully this mail reaches you!

I heard that SIC Systems let you go immediately after you completed your revolutionary self-hosting work. That is unconscionable! I'd heard that Ilano was cutthroat, but wow.

Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I found a job at a small startup that is working on a home computer with a graphical interface. It's revolutionary stuff, and we need someone with your technical skills to go to market.

Is there any chance you'd be open to discussing a lead engineering position over here?

If you're interested, let me know and I'll schedule a meeting with us and the two remaining founders (both named Steve, by coincidence).

Hope you're well!
