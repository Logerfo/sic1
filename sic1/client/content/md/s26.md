Incredible work, {{self.name}}! After consulting with the SIC Systems board, I've been given special permission to promote you to {{jobTitles[7].title}}.

You've shown tenacity to get this far, and you'll need loads of it for the next batch of tasks. We need to give the SIC-1 the ability to understand its own code, in order to unleash its immense computing power on optimizing its own performance. We'll be happy to provide on-site food and laundry service, home cleaning/maintenance, and fertility preservation services to you as part of your compensation package. We just need you to push through this one last sprint to the finish line. Your fellow SIC Systems family members thank you for your perseverance!
