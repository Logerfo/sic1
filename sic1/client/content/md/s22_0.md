Rick and Pat,

It has come to my attention that Pat's team has been discreetly working on natural language processing.

**This absolutely must stop.**

My team has been solely tasked (by the SIC Systems board) with designing and implementing the natural language processing pipeline for the SIC-1.

Your work is redundant and, to be blunt, a misuse of corporate resources. We cannot have two teams working independently on the same problem.

Pat, please turn over any documents you've created as a part of this duplicate effort immediately or I'll be forced to refer your entire team to corporate affairs for disciplinary action.
