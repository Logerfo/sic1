subject: REVERSE SEQUENCE???
---
I'm completely lost! How can I reverse a sequence when I don't even know its length??

Feng pointed me to the stack memory example, but that example only reverses 3 numbers. What if the sequence has 4 letters? Or 5???

This is starting to go way over my head... is there any chance I can copy your solution? I'll make sure to have it be a little slower so that it's not obvious I copied your work.

HELP!!!
