Hello, {{self.name}}!

I'm your manager, {{from.name}}, and I'm excited to have you join our team! We're working very hard to ship our flagship product, the SIC-1, on time and we need all the help we can get.

You've already met Mary from HR. The other members of your immediate team are Ted and Feng (note: their cubicles are unfortunately on the far end of this floor away from you--I'll see if I can get you moved closer). In case you see any welcome mail from Rick, be aware that he is my boss (so your skip-level boss). If you have any concerns, I kindly ask you to raise them directly with me before looping in Rick.

With introductions out of the way, let's talk about your job description. You are to implement programs as they're assigned to you. Your solutions will be compared to other employees' solutions on the basis of execution time (measured in cycles) and memory usage (measured in bytes).

Thanks in advance for your dedication!

P.S. Sorry if it was unclear that you would not be paid during training. There must have been a mix-up on HR's end. I'll see if there's anything I can do to right the situation.
