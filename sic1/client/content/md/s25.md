I wanted to let you know that Rick, Don, and Ted have all been let go.

On the surface, it might sound like this means that all the remaining natural language work now falls on your plate. But there's a silver lining: I've been given the go-ahead to offer you some non-cash perks to help you manage your schedule, namely:

* Free breakfast, lunch and dinner at the office
* On-site laundry service
* An optional home cleaning/maintenance service, if you need it

Thanks for pushing so hard these last few weeks and months!
