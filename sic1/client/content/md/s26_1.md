I'm sure you saw the mail from Ilano. He thinks highly of us, but he also expects a lot.

To properly motivate you, Ilano has created a new job title exclusively for you: **{{jobTitles[7].title}}**.

You've shown tenacity to get this far, and you'll need loads of it for the next batch of tasks. We need to give the SIC-1 the ability to understand its own code, in order to unleash its immense computing power on optimizing its own performance. In addition to existing perks, we'll be happy to provide:

* Free super-vitamins (used by Ilano himself), produced by Herbaleaf
* Optional sleeping quarters at the office
* Discounted fertility preservation services

We just need you to push through this one last sprint to the finish line. Your fellow SIC Systems family members thank you for your perseverance!
