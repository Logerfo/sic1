Don (and Don's team),

In recognition of Don's tireless efforts that have recently culminated in the ability of the SIC-1 to process sequences, I'd like everyone to join me in congratulating Don on his promotion to Principal Engineering Lead!

Don, I don't know how you managed to get sequences up and running so quickly, but we all owe a great debt to you.

Thank you once again!
