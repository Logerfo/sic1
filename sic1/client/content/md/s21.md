Greetings, {{self.name}}.

I just wanted to let you know that today will be my last day at SIC Systems. I've enjoyed working with you, and I hope that my occasional clarifying electronic mails have been as beneficial to your career as working with you has been to mine.

I generally try to distance myself from office politics and rumors, but I wanted to let you know that I have credible information that the SIC Systems board is currently trying to fend off a hostile takeover by Ilano Moscato (a foreign billionaire who is rather eccentric, to put it mildly).

Based on what I've heard from friends who've worked at Ilano's other companies, I'm expecting working conditions here to deteriorate rapidly. Ilano has a reputation for randomly pivoting strategies, overworking his employees, and even flouting certain laws.

I urge you to consider looking for employment elsewhere.

Best of luck to you, {{self.name}}!
