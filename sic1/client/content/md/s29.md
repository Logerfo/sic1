Engineering team,

Please disregard the previous errant electronic mail that was purportedly sent by Ilano. That mail was apparently actually sent by a rogue human resources employee, Mary Townsend (who has since been fired).

Ilano treats all employees with dignity and respect, and would never complain about a matter so trivial as food catering at a meeting. He understands that budget cuts are difficult and, in fact, he has willingly slashed his own salary by 10% in solidarity with all SIC Systems staff.

Thank you, and have a great day!
