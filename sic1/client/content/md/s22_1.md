Hi, {{self.name}}.

It's unfortunate that Jerin sent that mail without consulting me or Rick first, but I want you to know that the work you're doing is very important and we shouldn't let office politics get in the way.

You have made fantastic progress on natural language processing, and I'm confident that once the board sees our tremendous progress, Jerin will be forced to back down. This isn't the first time an overzealous manager has come knocking on my door. Everything will be fine.

Additionally, **I have put together a proposal to create a new position for you, with a significant pay bump**. If you can finish this next task, I'm sure the board will have no other option than to promote you to *Distinguished Engineer*.

Thanks for all the hard work you've put in so far!
