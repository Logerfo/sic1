Greetings, {{self.name}}.

After talking to Ted, I thought this might be a good time to remind everyone that you can use labels for both variables *and constants*. A label is really just an address, after all.

For example, if I want to be able to write out a 1, I could create a constant. Just remember that if you're subtracting the constant you'll want to negate the constant:

```
subleq @OUT, @n_one ; Write out a 1 by subtracting -1 from @OUT
                    ; Note: @OUT always reads as zero: 0 - (-1) = 1

@n_one: .data -1    ; Constant
```
