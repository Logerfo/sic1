I know this is sudden and unexpected, but you're going to be joining my team, effective today. Additionally, you have been promoted to {{jobTitles[3].title}}.

I'm still not entirely clear what happened with Don and the new sequence processing work, but Rick mentioned that Don was considering letting you go, and I thought that seemed unfair. Fortunately, Rick was willing to give me a chance to add you to my team.

Anyway, whatever happened, it's in the past now and we need to focus on the road ahead.

Thanks for your hard work!
