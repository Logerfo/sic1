Engineering team,

To help improve morale, SIC Systems has provided an officially sanctioned computer video game called "Avoision" for employees to play. If you think your work would benefit from an entertaining diversion, please feel free to compete against your coworkers for the highest score in "Avoision" (during your two legally-mandated unpaid breaks, or in lieu of an unneeded bathroom break).

You can find "Avoision" in the "Diversions" section of the program inventory and also in the main menu of the SIC-1 Development Environment.

Enjoy!
