Hi, {{self.name}}. In case we haven't met yet, I'm {{from.name}}, a peer to your old skip-level manager Rick. I'd like to congratulate you on the work you've done so far. What I've seen has been most impressive!

Effective immediately, you'll be reporting directly to me to continue your exciting work on natural language processing.

Additionally, I'd like to inform you that you've been promoted to **{{jobTitles[6].title}}** (although, due to budget cuts, we won't be able to honor the original compensation package that was discussed).

Looking forward to working with you!

P.S. Pat is no longer employed by SIC Systems.
