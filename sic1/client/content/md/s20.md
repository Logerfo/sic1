Hey, {{self.name}}.

I don't know if you've heard, but there are rumors that layoffs are coming. Now might be a good time to dust off your resume!

Speaking of which, do you think you'd have a few minutes to drop by my cubicle and tell me what you think of my resume?

Do you think it would be a stretch to say that I lead development of sequence processing for the SIC-1 (when I was really only just part of a larger team that worked on it)?

Thanks, man!
