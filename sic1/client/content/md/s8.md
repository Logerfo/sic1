Nice work on the arithmetic programs, {{self.name}}! As of this electronic mail, you have been promoted to {{jobTitles[2].title}}.

I know it's getting late (and please try to keep this to yourself), but our team really needs to improve our velocity. If there's any way you can stay late and complete your next task *today*, there is a very good chance that I'll be able to promote you to Senior Engineer (and that comes with a hefty pay bump).

Again, keep this to your self. This sort of rapid promotion is extremely rare. Obviously, I can't guarantee anything, but if you can knuckle down and churn out this next task, things are looking pretty good...

Thank you!
