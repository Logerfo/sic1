Hi, {{self.name}}! It's been a while since we last chatted.

How do you like working on Pat's team? It looks like you're making excellent progress (between you and me, I think you're doing most, if not all, of the work, though).

Don't share this with anyone, but I've been working with one of the other managers (Jerin Kransky) on setting up natural language processing functionality for the SIC-1.

Do you have any interest in re-joining my team? I already have Jerin convinced that you're the right person for the job, and I think another promotion would be in order if you'd be willing to come join us.

Let me know what you think!
