Spectacular work, {{self.name}}! Based on your innovative solutions, you have been promoted to **{{jobTitles[5].title}}**.

Please don't mention this to anyone else, but I've heard rumors that Don (your old boss) and Jerin (another manager) are struggling to make progress on their natural language processing pipeline for the SIC-1.

To be honest, I don't think their team has any engineers of your caliber. I know it's risky, but I'd like to put you to work on solving some of the natural language problems (under the radar, so to speak).

If we can show definitive progress soon, then I think the board would be willing to move the whole project onto our team. That would be a big (and, frankly, unprecedented) promotion for you.

Let me know if you have any concerns. And please don't share this will anyone (especially Ted)!

Thank you!
