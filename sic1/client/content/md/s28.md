Mary,

The food at the executive retreat was absolutely horrible. I don't know how these events worked before, but I always treat my executives to the finest culinary delights the world has to offer.

The caviar was almost inedible (definitely *not* the Caspian Sea beluga caviar I had specifically requested), and the cocktail weenies were similarly unpalatable (anything less than Boar's Pride should go in the dumpster).

What a disgrace!

P.S. Please reject all meeting requests with staff for the rest of the week. And please come up with convincing excuses this time!
