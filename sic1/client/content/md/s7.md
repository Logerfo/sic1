Hi, {{self.name}}! I'm {{from.name}} and I'm another engineering lead (I actually work on the same team as your manager, Don).

Feng (who used to report to me) mentioned that you've been making excellent progress!

Anyway, I've been tasked with helping to improve morale across the team, so if there's anything that you especially like or don't like about the workplace or your compensation (or your team in general), feel free to send me a mail. I'll make sure to keep all discussions private.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
