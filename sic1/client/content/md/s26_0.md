Jerin and {{self.name}},

Thanks for welcoming me. I'm excited to work with you!

Your team's work on natural language processing is near and dear to my heart. As you may have heard, I founded Neutralino a few years back, with a goal of allowing a machine to reason about itself.

I'd like to task you with a special project to bring a similar capability to the SIC-1, ideally by the end of this quarter. I've been shopping around this capability to various governments around the world, and already have "hand shake" agreements for a few multi-billion dollar orders.

To say that this work is important would be an understatement. It is revolutionary!

Regards,
