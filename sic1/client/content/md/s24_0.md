Engineering team,

As reported in the news, SIC Systems has agreed to be acquired by Ilano Moscato (majority owner and CEO of Edison, Herbaleaf, and Neutralino).

What this means for you:

* Your day-to-day duties remain the same
* No major changes to the organization are planned
* Ilano has indicated that he will honor all existing approved compensation packages (both cash and equity)

In other words: "business as usual".

Please don't let reports in the media distract you from your work.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!
