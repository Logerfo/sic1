I know we had discussed increasing your compensation, given the increased scope and impact of your work.

Unfortunately, Ilano has put a freeze on all new spending, so there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied.

Having said that, I'm sure that once your work is complete and Ilano sees what you've been able to accomplish, he'll make sure you're duly compensated. He might even want to shift you over to one of his other companies where technical know-how is needed.

Just keep your focus on the task at hand!
