Greetings, {{self.name}}. I'm also on Don's team and my name is {{from.name}}. Let me know if you ever need any help.

After helping Ted with the first assessment, I thought I'd share a couple of hints with you as well.

Did you notice that the "memory bytes accessed" chart for the "Data Directive and Looping" exercise showed that a few employees solved that task while only accessing 5 bytes of memory?

The "memory bytes accessed" statistic counts how many unique addresses were read or written during execution (of the first test set). Given that each instruction consists of 3 addresses and that `@IN` and `@OUT` are accessed for input and output, that means that the solution must only use a single `subleq` instruction that accesses `@IN` and `@OUT`.

See if you can figure out how they did that. I'll give you a hint: all the test inputs are positive, so subtracting them from `@OUT` (which reads as a zero) always results in a negative number, and execution will always branch.

Hope that helps!
